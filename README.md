# FallenOrder-ModManager
A mod manager for Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order. Installs required directories and DLLs for UE4 Blueprint Manipulation Mods and Visual Mods.

Credit to (https://github.com/RussellJerome) for creating the blueprint/logic mod DLL, that allows for those type of mods to be created/used.

How to use:

1 - *Go to the **releases page** and **download** the **latest release** (FallenOrder-ModManager.zip)*

2 - Once downloaded, *extract* the zip file. There should be two files called `JediFallenOrder - Mod Manager.exe` and a DLL called `AltoHttp.dll`.

3 - Run `JediFallenOrder - Mod Manager.exe`, and all required modding files/directories will be created, and you can drag and drop mod files into their respective windows. 

**Which Mods Go Where?**: If you dont know where certain mods should go, mods that start with *pakchunk99* go into the **Visual Mods** Section (to the left) and mods that *dont* start with pakchunk99 go into the **Blueprint/Gameplay Mods** Section (to the right)

**NOTE**: If your game is not saved in the path: *D:\Program Files (x86)\Jedi Fallen Order\SwGame* then a settings.ini file will be generated. Simply open the INI and replace `A:\FOLDER\Jedi Fallen Order\SwGame` with the path of your game's SwGame folder. Then save the settings.ini, and run `JediFallenOrder - Mod Manager.exe` like normal.
